- Familiarity with the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries
- Basic understanding of web development concepts (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)

## Lab Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

1. Retrieve historical stock and revenue data using a public API.
2. Perform data cleaning and manipulation using the Pandas library.
3. Analyze the data and calculate relevant financial metrics.
4. Visualize the data using Matplotlib to gain insights.
5. Build an interactive dashboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Lab Steps

The lab consists of the following steps:

1. **Setup:** Install the required Python libraries and set up the project structure.
2. **Retrieve Data:** Retrieve historical stock and revenue data using a public API.
3. **Data Cleaning and Manipulation:** Clean and manipulate the data to prepare it for analysis.
4. **Data Analysis:** Perform analysis on the data and calculate relevant financial metrics.
5. **Data Visualization:** Visualize the data using Matplotlib to gain insights.
6. **Building the Dashboard:** Create an interactive dashboard using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
